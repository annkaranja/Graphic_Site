	<h1>Color Theory</h1>
	Colors set a mood, attract attention, or make a statement. Color can be used to energize, or cool down. By selecting the right color scheme, you can create an ambiance of elegance, warmth or tranquility, or you can convey an image of playful youthfulness.<strong>Color can be your most powerful design element if you learn to use it effectively.</strong><hr>

	<h1>Color wheel</h1>
	A circle with different coloured sectors used to show the relationship between colours.<br>It helps us choose which colours work together.<hr>

    <h1>Primary, Secondary and Tertiary colors</h1>
    Primary colors are red, yellow and blue.<br>
	The three secondary colors (green, orange and purple) are created by mixing two primary colors.<br>
	Tertiary colors are created by mixing primary and secondary colors.<br><hr>

	<h1>Warm and cool colors</h1>
	The color circle can be divided into warm and cool colors.Warm colors are vivid and energetic,and tend to advance in space.Cool colors give an impression of calm, and create a soothing impression.White, black and gray are considered to be neutral.<hr>

	<h1>Tints, Shades, and Tones</h1>
	These terms are often used incorrectly, although they describe fairly simple color concepts. If a color is made lighter by adding white, the result is called a tint. If black is added, the darker version is called a shade. And if gray is added, the result is a different tone.<hr>	

	<h1>Color harmonies</h1>
	  <h2>Complimentary colors</h2>
	Colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel e.g red and green.
	The high contrast of complementary colors creates a vibrant look especially when used at full saturation.
	Complementary color schemes are tricky to use in large doses, but work well when you want something to stand out.
    Complementary colors are really bad for text.

      <h2>Analogous colors</h2>
    Analogous color schemes use colors that are next to each other on the color wheel.They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs.Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are harmonious and pleasing to the eye.Make sure you have enough contrast when choosing an analogous color scheme.Choose one color to dominate,a second to support.The third color is used (along with black, white or gray) as an accent.

      <h2>Triadic color scheme</h2>
	A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel.Triadic color schemes tend to be quite vibrant, even if you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues.To use a triadic harmony successfully, the colors should be carefully balanced - let one color dominate and use the two others for accent.

	  <h2>Split-Complementary color scheme</h2>
	The split-complementary color scheme is a variation of the complementary color scheme. In addition to the base color, it uses the two colors adjacent to its complement.This color scheme has the same strong visual contrast as the complementary color scheme, but has less tension.The split-complimentary color scheme is often a good choice for beginners, because it is difficult to mess up.
    
      <h2>Rectangle (tetradic) color scheme</h2> 
	The rectangle or tetradic color scheme uses four colors arranged into two complementary pairs.This rich color scheme offers plenty of possibilities for variation.Tetradic color schemes works best if you let one color be dominant.You should also pay attention to the balance between warm and cool colors in your design.

	  <h2>Square color scheme</h2> 
	The square color scheme is similar to the rectangle, but with all four colors spaced evenly around the color circle.Square color schemes works best if you let one color be dominant.You should also pay attention to the balance between warm and cool colors in your design.
